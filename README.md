# Future-Sales-Prediction

## Description
The Future Sales Prediction project aims to forecast future sales based on historical sales data. By analyzing patterns and trends in past sales, the project utilizes machine learning algorithms to make predictions for future sales, enabling businesses to make informed decisions regarding inventory management, resource allocation, and revenue forecasting.

## Features
The project provides the following features:
1. Data Preparation: The project supports data preprocessing and preparation, including data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering. It handles various data formats and ensures data quality before the prediction phase.
2. Model Training: The project employs machine learning algorithms to train models based on historical sales data. It includes multiple algorithms such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks, allowing users to choose the most suitable model for their specific needs.
3. Model Evaluation: The project provides evaluation metrics to assess the performance of trained models. These metrics help users understand the accuracy and reliability of the predictions and compare different models to identify the most effective one.
4. Prediction Generation: Once the models are trained, the project enables users to generate future sales predictions based on new input data. Users can input relevant features such as historical sales, pricing information, promotional activities, and external factors to generate accurate forecasts.
5. Visualization: The project offers visualization capabilities to present the predicted sales data in an intuitive and understandable manner. It includes charts, graphs, and interactive visualizations that enable users to gain insights from the predicted sales patterns and trends.

## Dependencies
The project relies on the following dependencies:
1. Python 3.8 or above
2. numpy
3. pandas
4. scikit-learn
5. matplotlib
6. seaborn
